This is a collection of templates to aid in creating common support tickets on Pantheon.

## add site to agcdn

Before you do this be sure that the site referred to in this ticket:

1. is created by the websupport user
2. it has been deployed to the live environment
3. the agcdn domain has been added to the live environment

--> see [creating a new site](wiki/Pantheon-creating-a-new-site)

When opening the support ticket simply select the most relevant options from the select boxes etc. Replace SITE_NAME, SITE_PATH, and PANTHEON_SITE_ID in the template with the relevant values.
