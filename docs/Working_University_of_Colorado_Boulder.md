# CU Boulder

Here are a few websites that are useful for new employees (a lot of what follows is included in these links):

- [starting at CU Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/hr/new-employees)
- [HR](https://www.colorado.edu/hr)

There are a number of things that you will need to keep track of while working here and this document is intended to list the most common items.

## Identikey

Perhaps the most important is your Identikey, which you use to access all of the university's services, software tools (zoom, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft Outlook, etc), and our team's development privileges for the websites we build and manage.

- An IdentiKey consists of a CU Boulder username and password. You must [activate your account](https://identikey.colorado.edu/) in order to set your security questions and password.
- If you were previously an employee, temporary employee or student employee, then you most likely already have an IdentiKey. Visit the [IdentiKey website](https://identikey.colorado.edu/) to verify/reset your password.
- You will need your employee ID to activate your IdentiKey.  This number should be provided in your onboarding emails.
- You will need the last four digits of your social security number to activate your IdentiKey. If you do not have a social security number, please contact [oithelp@colorado.edu](mailto:oithelp@colorado.edu) or 303-735-4357 for a 4-digit pin number.

## My.Cu Portal

This the university's protal for employees and is used for managing your timesheets, time off, training, and many other things. To get there:

- got to [my cu](https://my.cu.edu)
- click on CU Boulder
- sign in to fedauth using your identikey (see you are already using it!)
- you are here!

You should see a bunch of 'cards' at this point, each of which lets you access certain functionalities. Some important ones given below.

### _**paychecks**_

Click on this card to set up direct deposit. This is how we get paid so make sure you do this! Also found here is tax and related settings and information.

### _**my leave**_

When you first visit this section, it will prompt you to add your working hours. We typically submit 8 to 5 with an hour lunch break for pay calculation purposes. This can later be changed by going to 'My Leave Preferences" should your schedule change.

At the beginning of each month we have to submit our timesheets for the previous month's work. This is very important since you will not get paid otherwise. To do this:

- click on "My Leave"
- click on the "Timesheet" tab in the upper left
- check the data in the table that opens and make sure that it is correct
- if so scroll down to the bottom and check the box and click submit
- you did it, you should get paid at some point!!!

Another important function of the "My Leave" section of the portal requesting time off:

- click on one of the calendar tabs in the upper left
- click on a day for which you want to request time off
- fill in the form that shows up
- be sure to enter the correct earnings code from the drop-down
- same for the status dropdown
- click save
- your manager will approve/disapprove the request

### _**benefits and wellness**_

This is where you enroll in your health, dental and other benefit programs. You will have to do this once a year during the university's open enrollment period, which is normally sometime in April to May.

The benefits that you sign up for will be in effect as of the 1st of July to the end June the next year. Once the open enrollment period is closed you will not be able to make changes to your selected benefits until the next open enrollment period.

### _**other cards**_

Be sure to look around in your portal as there are many things to learn about here.

## Office suites

Everyone at Strategic Relations and Communications gets an gets two email addresses:

- <YOUR_IDENTIKEY@colorado.edu>
- <FIRSTNAME.LASTNAME@colorado.edu>

In practice there is not much difference between these two emails as they both go to the same Microsoft outlook mailbox. However, we do use Google services for which the identikey email is needed to login.

### _**Microsoft**_

We use Microsoft Teams for team and organization chats (and occasional voice and video calls for meetings) as well as Microsoft Outlook for email communications and calendar/planning. You can use download their apps or just go to the websites to use them. You sign in with your identikey.

### _**Zoom**_

Zoom is the preferred application used for video conferencing. We have regular meetings using it. Download their app and sign-in with your .... identikey!

## University Provided Equipment

Basically, this is a Macbook Pro provided by the Office of Information Technology, who will have setup an administrator user account (you will need an admin account) on it for you.
