# Remote Working

## **meetings**

Our team operates in a 'fully' remote work modality. Single quotes are used because we do plan to see each other in person from time to time, although, this is not a work requirement in any way.

### **in person meettings**

We have three recurring in person meetings, neither of which is required:

1. 'Office Days'. These are periodic meetings that are scheduled with input from the whole team. Originally, these were scheduled the first Monday of every month but are now seen more as an 'as needed' option.
2. Team lunches. We have recently decided to meet once a month for lunch. This offers us more flexibility in the location of our meetings, since our team is spread around the Front Range.
3. All staff meetings. These are meetings in the ARC building meant for the whole SRC staff to attend in person, if desired, or via Zoom.

### **regularly scheduled meetings**

These are held via Zoom and the Web Team is expected to attend.

1. **Monday 9:45 am** - Stand-up meeting of the larger Constituent Experience and Technology team
2. **Monday 10am** - Stand-up for the Web Team
3. **Tuesday 2pm** - Web Team project management
4. **Friday 9am** - Web Team social meeting for mostly non-work related talk
5. **TBD** - One-on-One meeting with your manager

## **communication**

Remote work offers our team a great deal of flexibility, but also responsibility, particularly in relation to communication. With this in mind, we are very careful to stay in regular and close communication. We commonly use 3 tools to communicate:

1. Microsoft Teams
    - desktop app
    - mobile app
    - slack like interface and functionality
    - used for communicating accross the SRC
    - we primarily use channels related to our team's work:
        1. Developers
        2. Operations
2. Microsoft Outlook
    - you know, email
    - used for important campus, staff, and other communications (always good to stay on top of these)
3. Ad hoc video meetings
    - used for any purpose as needed
    - collaboration with co-worker
    - pair-programming
    - we have access to Zoom as well as Teams video meetings

All of the above tools are tied to your identikey. If you are logged in with that you are ready to go.

Since we are all remote we all strive to message and respond to others with respect. If you will be away from your computer for a long stretch of time, just let us know. If someone messages you with a question respond promptly. Although we all get along very well, it bears saying again regarding text based communication -- it is best to assume good intentions of co-workers.
