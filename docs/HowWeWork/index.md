# Team Philosophy

## What we expect from each other

- Ask lots of questions. Always feel free to ask why something is the way it is
- Respond to questions in a timely manner
- Take ownership of parts of our work and gain deep knowledge on one or more projects
- Give and receive useful constructive feedback. We all need to work together to make things better. 
- Let your manager (and team mates) know about problems before they become nightmares: tickets, people, projects, meetings, committees, etc.
- Work during normal hours (don't feel the need to respond to email or slack in the evenings)
- Take time off. When you are off, be fully off; no email or Slack.

## Principles

- Heroic efforts are not a sustainable resource, we work to avoid them
- We are all learning, no dumb questions. Only dumb mistake is going too fast.
- Fast follow. We don't want to deal with the cost of being on the - bleeding edge, but we want to quickly move to new technology that is appearing as a winner.
