# Team Philosophy

## team values

- We are transparent by default
- We assume good intentions
- We are all on the same team and want to present a unified front
- We are committed to making steady, meaningful and continuous improvements
- We are committed to principles of inclusion and equity and we strive to collaborate well with others

## what we expect from each other

- Ask lots of questions. Always feel free to ask why something is the way it is
- Respond to questions in a timely manner
- Take ownership of parts of our work and gain deep knowledge on one or more projects
- Give and receive useful constructive feedback. We all need to work together to make things better
- Let your manager (and team mates) know about problems before they become nightmares: tickets, people, projects, meetings, committees, etc
- Work during normal hours (don't feel the need to respond to email or slack in the evenings)
- Take time off
- When you are off, be fully off; no email or Microsoft Teams etc.

## guiding principles

- Heroic efforts are not a sustainable resource, we work to avoid them
- We are all learning, no dumb questions. Only dumb mistake is going too fast.
- Fast follow. We don't want to deal with the cost of being on the - bleeding edge, but we want to quickly move to new technology that is appearing as a winner.
- Create projects that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of situations
- Safeguard the privacy and security of our users
- Only retain data that we can securely and responsibly store
- Work on impactful projects in an iterative manner, using emerging best-in-class tools
- Clearly communicate our work via documentation, changelogs, and standardized processes
- Work as a team and minimize dependencies on single people
