## office location

[Administrative & Research Center](https://www.colorado.edu/res/research-building-system/arc-administrative-research-center)  
3100 Marine St. Boulder, 80309  
5th floor

Currently, all of our team members work fully remotely.  However if a team member, now or in the future, would prefer to have a more traditional work enviornment (aka office-space) accomodation on the 5th floor of the ARC building will be made.  

## our projects

The main projects we are working on now are listed below. We often have other things happening as well, but this is where our current focus is.

1. New CMS
    - We are building a new version of our Web Express CMS which is designed to allow site builders and editors, who likely do not know how to code, to build rich web experiences through www.colorado.edu branded websites.
    - It is built using the latest version of Drupal as a foundation with significant customomization on top.
2. Migration of sites from current D7 Web Express to the new CMS
    - We are currently (as of the start of 2024) beginning the migration process and expect that the migration of the over 1300 websites that make up the www.colorado.edu website will be mostly if not completely finished by the end of the calendar year.  
3. Oghma
    - This is a new application and API that will be the center of knowledge and management tool for our websites
4. Old Drupal 7 based CMS.
    - we are responsible for care and maintenance of the legacy CMS system that is still widely used until the migration process is completed.   

## development principles  

Particularly with respect to Drupal development, but for custom development we always attempt to : 

- Keep it simple
- Keep it close to core
- Keep it secure
- Keep it maintainable
- Keep it scalable
- Keep improving

## aspirational development principles 

These are things the teams believes are important but we can't yet claim to be doing well.  We hope to make improvments in this space and move these into the devlopment principles in the future.  Many will be more targeted projects once the migration work listed above is completed. 

- Keep it documented 
  - There is another team that works to document the UI/UX of the Web Express product, we're referring specifically to the technial documentation, including architecture decision records.
- Keep it tested 
  - Test-Driven Development would be ideal but getting usability and visual regression testing added in will be the next step
- Keep changes logged 
  - We currently are logging change within individual repos however we don't currently have a good mechanism to show the changes the Web Express product across the dozens of repos that make up its codebase. 

## team values

- We are transparent by default 
- We assume good intentions and are happy to share our own good intentions whenever asked
- We are all on the same team and want to present a unified front
- We are committed to making steady, meaningful and continuous improvements
- We are committed to principles of inclusion and equity and we strive to collaborate well with others

## what we expect from each other

- Ask lots of questions. Always feel free to ask why something is the way it is
  - Note that a lot of the tools we use are idiosyncratic (aka "Drupalisms").  If something seems opaque or unclear it's not a failing on your part, it just means the team hasn't explained those quirks to you yet
- Respond to questions in a timely manner
- Commit early; commit often.  All of your work should be added to a a development branch in a repo and you should be commiting your work to your working branch frequently even before it is ready to be reviewed and merged into the main branch.
- Take ownership of parts of our work and gain deep knowledge on one or more projects
- Give and receive useful constructive feedback. We all need to work together to make things better
- Let your manager (and team mates) know about problems before they become nightmares: tickets, people, projects, meetings, committees, etc
- Work during normal hours (don't feel the need to respond to email or MS Teams in the evenings)
- Take time off
- When you are off, be fully off; no email or Microsoft Teams etc

## guiding principles

- Heroic efforts are not a sustainable resource, we work to avoid them
- We are all learning
  - the web is constantly changing with new standards, tools and technologies, which requires all of us to invest in continuous learning
  - no dumb questions
- Don't beat your head against the wall until the wall crumbles -- instead reach out for help from your team to get over, under or around the wall
- Fast follow
  - we don't want to deal with the cost of being on the - bleeding edge
  - however, we want to quickly move to new technology that is appearing as a winner
- Create projects that are usable by people with the widest possible range of abilities, operating within the widest possible range of situations
- Safeguard the privacy and security of our users
- Only retain data that we can securely and responsibly store
- Work on impactful projects in an iterative manner, using emerging best-in-class tools
- Clearly communicate our work via documentation, changelogs, and standardized processes
- Work as a team and minimize dependencies on individual team members (cross-train and diversify responsibility)
