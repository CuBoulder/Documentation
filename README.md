# Documentation

## What goes here?

This is a repository for our Team's general documentation. Many things belong here:

- On boarding information
- Tools we use and how to set them up
- Common tasks that need to be executed
- General information for and links to our main projects
- Other things we all need to know or are likely to look up.

## What does not go here?

Documentation for particular projects, which should live in each project's repository.

## Adding to documentation

All documentation goes in the `docs` directory. You can follow this kind of structure:

```text
docs
|___subject1
|   |   relevant_doc
|   |   another_relevant_doc
|   |
|   |___subfolder
|       |   subfolder_doc
|
|
|___subject2
|   |   relevant_doc
|   |   another_relevant_doc
```
