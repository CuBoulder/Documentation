# Documentation

## What goes here?

This is a repository for our Team's general documentation. Many things belong here:
- On boarding information
- Tools we use and how to set them up
- Common tasks that need to be executed
- General information for and links to our main projects
- Other things we all need to know or are likely to look up.

## What does not go here?

Basically documentation for particular projects, which should live in each project's repository.
